    "### What textual information is included in XBRL?\n",
    "XBRL filings include text blocks of financial statement footnotes *only*, and not of other sections (e.g., business description, risk factors, or management's discussion and analysis sections). Nevertheless, extracting individual footnote textual information from regular plain-text/HTML filings is significantly more difficult compared to text in other sections (because financial statement footnotes greatly vary in formatting and placement across filers). For Python examples on how to extract text of sections other than financial statement footnotes, see [Using Python for Text Analysis in Accounting Research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3576098).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do I need to know to extract a specific footnote from XBRL 10-K document?\n",
    "The most important piece of information to know is a set of possible XBRL tags used to represent the text blocks of a specific footnote. For example, Significant Accounting Policies footnote can be represented using one of the following standard US-GAAP XBRL tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *SignificantAccountingPoliciesTextBlock*\n",
    "- *BasisOfPresentationAndSignificantAccountingPoliciesTextBlock*\n",
    "- *OrganizationConsolidationAndPresentationOfFinancialStatementsDisclosureAndSignificantAccountingPoliciesTextBlock*\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, income tax footnote text is tagged using only one XBRL concept:\n",
    "- *IncomeTaxDisclosureTextBlock*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I identify XBRL tags for a given footnote?\n",
    "You can search for a specific tags used to represent footnotes either through [XBRL Taxonomy Viewer](https://xbrlview.fasb.org) viewer or by downloading taxonomy files from the [FASB's website](https://fasb.org/Page/PageContent?PageId=/xbrl/2022financial.html).\n",

    "## Extracting textual information from XBRL reports: practical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to identify, collect, and parse text blocks from raw XBRL filings (as submitted to the SEC by the filers), it is a difficult task. Therefore, the Office of Structured Disclosure (OSD) created publicly available datasets with numeric and textual data extracted from XBRL filings. The benefit of these datasets is that they are reported in a tabular format and textual data has been converted from HTML format to plain-text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are available through this [link](https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-and-notes-data-set.html) and are organized into year-quarter (before 2020) and year-month (since 2020) archive files. Each such archive contains information about the XBRL filings filed in the given *calendar period* (e.g., accession number, company name, report date, etc.) and XBRL data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use Python (or other programming language) to:\n",
    " 1) read filing information table,\n",
    " 2) read tables with data and keep only relevant footnotes (e.g., income tax footnote), and\n",
    " 3) merge filing information and textual data into one table.\n",
